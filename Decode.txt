                                              Decode  Program  Explanation
                                              
    Inorder  to  count  the number of decoding possible a function countDecoding is implemented  with parameters a char array and int n.A table to store result of 
    subproblems is also implemented. For the base condition (“01123”) zero is returned.

if (digits[i - 1] > '0') 
  count[i] = count[i - 1];
   If the last digit is not 0,then last digit must add to the number of words.
if (digits[i - 2] == '1' || 
          (digits[i - 2] == '2' && 
          digits[i - 1] < '7'))   
            
            count[i] += count[i - 2];
 If the second last digit is smaller than 2 and last digit is smaller than 7 then last two digits form a valid character.

On executing the code we will get the count of number of decoding possible.
